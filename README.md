# redoxspecies_activelearning
This is a Bayesian-Optimization-based active learning algorithm that navigates through a dataset of molecules to identify a set of molecules with 
reduction potential within the range of 1.40<E<1.70. 
This code was based on an original code from the paper “Quantum Chemistry-Informed Active Learning to Accelerate the Design and Discovery of Sustainable 
Energy Storage Materials”, which you can check out here: https://github.com/hieuadoan/QM-ActiveLearning-Paper
